# ICG-Summer_Program-2021
This repository contains my work done in the summer program conduct by IITK Consulting group in summers of 2021 .

In this project we were introduced to regression algorithms , decision trees & neural networks .
Following are the tasks done in this project :
- Implemented Logistic Regression over the titanic dataset .
- Devised Decision Tree algorithm over the titanic dataset .
- Implemented a basic neural network using PyTorch and trained it over Fashion MNIST dataset , obtaining an accuracy of 80.86% over the test dataset
